title: Unicorn — personal branding
description: It's the least humble thing in the world, calling yourself a
  'unicorn', but that's what a designer who codes is supposedly called.

## Background

I'm torn between using my name as an identifier for my personal site or whether or not I should have a brand, a logo of some sort. On the one hand I'm not a business or a freelance developer, so a personal brand feels like an overkill. 

Either way, I wanted the challenge. I needed something that defines me, and represents what I do. And I've always liked the idea that a developer with design skills or vice versa is called a "unicorn" — described as a mythical creature, a rare thing to encounter in the wild. And on the other hand it's the most pretentious thing I've ever heard. 

There is a cliche out there, that developers don't know how to design, and designers being sucky at understanding what it's like to actually bring their wacky, over-animated Dribbble designs to life. I've even written a satire post about the latter. Still there are levels to 

So I set out to create this logo, this unicorn emblem of sort. I'm quite happy with the result, but I don't think it's going at the top of my printed resume.
