I'm always trying to create stuff you'd normally would need JavaScript to accomplish with only CSS. My goal is to showcase how powerful CSS is. 

Although I wouldn't use this particular component on a real project I think it still shows how effective the correct use of sibling selectors and psuedo-classes can be.
