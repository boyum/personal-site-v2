I'm an avid user of [CodePen](https://codepen.io/havardob) and huge fan of their community. It's become somewhat a daily hobby of mine to use this platform to recreate Dribbble shots or explore the many possiblities CSS has to offer.

A few of my pens has also been featured in the [CodePen Spark](https://codepen.io/spark) newsletter and in the [The Most Hearted Pens of 2020](https://codepen.io/2020/popular/pens/4).

Here are some of my personal favorites.
